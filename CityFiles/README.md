# City Files Location
For the game to properly load and function, the files located in the CityFiles directory must be placed in the application's persistent data location. Each mission, other than Free Play, has its own starter city to load from the corresponding city file. On a PC system, this location is:


```C:/Users/<USER>>/AppData/LocalLow/DefaultCompany/Green City Builder```

Ensure that the City Files are correctly copied to this folder for the game to load and save city data properly.
