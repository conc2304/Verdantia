Import the package 'HDRP_Import_Extra_Fogs_' to get the extra, separate sky and fog settings for each camera as showcased in the Asset Store.

If the camera uses its spesific sky & fog and/or directional light settings please turn of the general sky and fog and/or directional light.
If there is no additional sky fog / light setting under the camera, this means it uses the general settings.
