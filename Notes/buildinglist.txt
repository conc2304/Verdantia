The Large Campus Office is a significant contributor to both the city's economy and job opportunities, boosting city happiness through employment. However, its expansive structure and materials contribute to the urban heat island effect, increasing surrounding temperatures. While it offers green spaces on campus that help counteract heat and add aesthetic value, it also generates pollution and has a considerable carbon footprint due to high energy demands. Balancing these environmental impacts with its economic benefits is key to maintaining a healthy, thriving city.

Mid-rise Apartment:
The Mid-rise Apartment provides essential housing for urban residents but has a moderate impact on the environment. Its structure contributes to the urban heat island effect, as the building materials absorb and retain heat, raising local temperatures. This apartment type also generates a moderate amount of pollution and has a notable carbon footprint due to its energy consumption, which can affect both air quality and public health. Although it lacks green spaces, upgrading to eco-friendly building materials and adding rooftop gardens or green facades could mitigate some of its environmental impact, aligning it more closely with sustainable urban goals.
