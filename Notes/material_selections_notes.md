Reflective glass façades cause multiple reflections of solar radiation, leading to higher surrounding air temperatures.
This increased local temperature results in a higher cooling load for the building.
The surface temperature of the reflective façades was significantly higher than surrounding areas, highlighting the heat retention caused by the glass.

The more a material radiates heat, the more likely it is to contribute to heat islands. 

For example, clean concrete pavement has a slightly lower emissivity rating than asphalt, making it a better option for pavement. Similarly, lighter-colored roofing systems have lower ratings than traditional black tar roofs. 

These strategies also help regulate thermal comfort, create a more pleasant occupant experience, and improve the efficiency of your cooling system.

While city-wide tree planting efforts are one of the most effective solutions

Green roofs, however, can help moderate daytime temperatures. One study finds that green roof temperatures can be 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit lower than conventional roofing systems. 


OD areas, with high-density buildings and corridors, face significant challenges related to poor air quality, higher temperatures, and elevated energy demands for air conditioning. The study focuses on the thermal properties of commonly used building materials, such as heavyweight materials (concrete, brick) and lightweight materials (glass, aluminum), and their influence on energy efficiency and the urban thermal environment.

The findings highlight that both heavyweight and lightweight materials contribute to the UHI phenomenon. Heavyweight materials, such as concrete and brick, store heat during the day and release it at night, causing higher nighttime temperatures. Lightweight materials, such as glass and aluminum, heat up quickly and transfer heat to both the indoor and outdoor environment, increasing cooling demands and energy use.

The paper emphasizes the need for mitigating UHI through better material choices, such as using reflective surfaces, thermal insulation, and incorporating vegetation to lower air temperatures and reduce solar heat gain.

Materials for Climate-Friendly Buildings:

Concrete & Asphalt:
Challenges: High heat capacity and thermal conductivity cause these materials to store and release significant amounts of heat, contributing to UHI.
Mitigation: Use reflective coatings or permeable concrete to reduce heat absorption, and add green infrastructure to minimize heat retention.

Brick:
Challenges: Absorbs and stores heat, releasing it at night, increasing cooling demand in summer but reducing heating needs in winter.
Mitigation: Incorporate insulation and design strategies to minimize heat absorption.

Aluminum:
Challenges: High thermal conductivity means it transfers heat easily, increasing indoor temperatures and energy consumption for cooling.
Mitigation: Use thermal breaks and insulation to improve energy efficiency.

Glass:
Challenges: Transmits and reflects heat, contributing to both indoor and outdoor temperature increases, especially when using reflective glass.
Mitigation: Use low-emissivity (low-E) coatings, double-glazing, or triple-glazing to reduce heat transfer.


Recommendations for Climate-Friendly Materials:
Reflective Surfaces: Use materials with high albedo (reflective surfaces) to reduce heat absorption.
Thermal Insulation: Apply insulation on building facades, especially those exposed to high solar radiation, to reduce energy consumption and UHI effects.
Vegetation: Integrate green roofs, green walls, and trees to cool the surrounding environment and provide shading.
Low-Emissivity Glass: Opt for low-E glass to limit heat transfer and improve building energy efficiency.
