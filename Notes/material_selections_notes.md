Reflective glass façades cause multiple reflections of solar radiation, leading to higher surrounding air temperatures.
This increased local temperature results in a higher cooling load for the building.
The surface temperature of the reflective façades was significantly higher than surrounding areas, highlighting the heat retention caused by the glass.
